# Phase 4 – Expansion Pack

Welcome to the optional expansion sessions! These sessions are completely optional but offer great fun and valuable practice with Java fundamentals and test automation patterns.

## What You'll Learn

- **Session 11 – Map & Reputation**: Use HashMap for data-driven rules (lookup tables, key-value pairs)
- **Session 12 – Failure Reasons**: Add diagnostic output to understand why tests fail
- **Session 13 – Test Run Harness**: Structure tests with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Session 14 – Structured Result**: Return rich objects instead of simple booleans for better diagnostics
- **Session 15 – CSV Ledger**: Load test data from CSV files (external test data management)
- **Session 16 – Parameterized Cases**: Run the same test logic against multiple data sets
- **Session 17 – Human Readable Reports**: Format test output for human consumption with aligned columns
- **Session 18 – Season Statistics**: Aggregate and analyze test results (counting, finding patterns)

## Should You Do This Phase?

**Skip if:**
- You're tired or losing steam
- You want to move on to the main course quickly
- Sessions 1-10 felt like enough

**Do it if:**
- You're enjoying the Bridgerton theme
- You want more Java practice before the main course
- Data-driven testing sounds interesting
- You like seeing patterns emerge from code

## No Pressure

Phase 4 is a bonus. Session 10 achieves the main warmup goal. Everything here is extra credit, designed to deepen your comfort with Java and preview test automation concepts you'll see in the main course.
